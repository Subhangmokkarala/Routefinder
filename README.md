# Reinforcement Learning Pathfinder

## Overview

The "Reinforcement Learning Pathfinder" project implements a Q-learning algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid environment. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to visualize the agent's learning and testing process.

## Tasks Checklist

- [x] Set up project structure and version control.
- [x] Implement grid environment with states and actions.
- [x] Develop Q-learning algorithm.
- [x] Create GUI for visualization and interaction.
- [ ] Enhance Q-learning with deep learning (Deep Q-Network).
- [ ] Implement Double Q-learning for improved performance.
- [ ] Add dynamic obstacle handling to the environment.
- [ ] Incorporate multi-agent collaboration for complex scenarios.
- [ ] Develop training and testing scripts for the RL agent.
- [ ] Optimize hyperparameters for better convergence.
- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation and code comments.
- [ ] Conduct performance analysis and benchmarking.
- [ ] Test RL agent in various grid configurations.
- [ ] Address any bugs or issues reported.
- [ ] Finalize project for deployment.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reinforcement-learning-pathfinder.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd reinforcement-learning-pathfinder
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the GUI application:
   ```bash
